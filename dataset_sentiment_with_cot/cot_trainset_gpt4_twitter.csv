B. Negative",A,B,60,"Analyzing this sentence can be a bit complex due to its multi-part structure Let's address it piece by piece Firstly, [@nickjacob_116 I would like to see something else] implies a neutral sentiment: the speaker just expresses a desire without showing any negative or positive emotions The second part [Twitter is awesome] clearly presents a positive sentiment as the user expresses admiration for Twitter The third segment [It doesn't compete with troops and AKs] appears neutral; it makes a statement of comparison but doesn't inherently convey positivity or negativity Finally, [Sorry] suggest either a neutral or a negative sentiment - it may imply that the user apologizes for something (which can often be associated with a negative context) or simply expresses politeness (neutral)

Answer and Confidence (0-100): A, 60% 

The analysis provides a balance of mostly neutral parts with some hints of both positive and negative sentiment However, since the positive sentiment [""Twitter is awesome""] is more clear-cut and inherently emotive compared to the slightly negative connotation of [Sorry], the overall sentiment can be considered slightly toward the positive side Still, due to the ambiguousness and multi-part structure of the sentence, the confidence level is on the lower side"

4 ""so im going to be a twitterpooper"" – the user is indicating they will stop engaging in the Twitter conversation Depending on context, this can lean negative as it implies an end to the interaction
5 ""and go to bed"" – just states that the user is going to sleep, neutral sentiment
6 ""night all thanks for the laughsXX"" - indicates that they've had a pleasing and entertaining time This leans towards a positive sentiment

Given that there are more negative than positive elements, but none are overly extreme or strongly negative, the overall sentiment could be interpreted as slightly negative

"It's raining again this morning. My sister wake me up at this time, but I'm still sleepy","A. Positive
B. Negative",B,B,72,"The sentence's analysis would be as follows: 

The initial part of the sentence reveals that it is raining in the morning again This in itself is neutral, but depending on the context it may be positive (if the speaker likes rain or if the place needed some) or negative (if the speaker dislikes rain or the place has had too much already) 

The second part of the sentence states that the speaker's sister woke them up, this can also be regarded as neutral, as it is simply stating a fact without any apparent emotional tone 

In the last part of the sentence, the speaker indicates that despite being woken up, they are still sleepy This suggests a negative sentiment, because the speaker is dissatisfied or unhappy with the fact they are still feeling sleepy

Given that the emotions expressed (or implied) in the statement are more negative (the speaker's sleepiness), I would categorize the sentiment of the sentence as more negative

@imjstsayin My son loves WoW but we are not working so he is outta luck for now.,"A. Positive
B. Negative",B,B,90,"This sentence begins by identifying a user @imjstsayin and stating that the speaker's son loves WoW (short for 'World of Warcraft', a popular video game) This statement in itself holds a positive sentiment as it indicates joy or interest from the son towards the game 

However, the subsequent part of the sentence states that ""we are not working"" - due to the current context of a global pandemic, this is likely a reference to job loss or financial instability which holds a negative sentiment 

Then, the sentence ends with ""so he is outta luck for now,"" implying that the son can't play WoW currently, likely due to the financial struggle mentioned earlier This is also a negative sentiment as it suggests a negative circumstance (not being able to do something he enjoys) due to an uncontrollable situation (financial issues) 

Therefore, after analyzing the sentence as a whole, the sentiment is negative, as although the son's love for WoW is positive in itself, the overall situation (financial struggles leading to inability to play the game) leads to a sad or unfortunate conclusion
