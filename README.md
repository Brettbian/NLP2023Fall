### 4. ARC
#### Overview
[ARC dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai2_arc/viewer/ARC-Easy)contains ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge sets, which consists of two distinct sets: ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge. The original ARC-Easy dataset contains approximately 5.2k entries, while the ARC-Challenge includes around 2.59k entries. Given computational constraints, we have processed a subset for practical handling, as detailed below::
- **Training Set:** 600 entries
- **Validation Set:** 200 entries
- **Test Set:** 200 entries

#### Subset Selection
Combined equal parts from ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge, ensuring variety.

#### Processing and Access
