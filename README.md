## Generate mutilple choice dataset with COT by GPT
### McTest
The original dataset comprises 2,000 entries. Given the limitations of our computational resources, we've created a subset of this data for effective processing. The subset includes:

- **Training Set:** 240 entries
- **Test Set:** 240 entries
- **Validation Set:** 120 entries

[mctest160.ipynb](.gpt-multiple-choice-cot-dataset-generator/mctest160/mctest160.ipynb): This Jupyter notebook contains the code that details the process of dataset generation, preprocessing, and model training/testing.

The generated dataset is hosted on the Hugging Face platform under the repository `BENBENBENb/mc160cot`. This allows for easy access and integration with machine learning pipelines.
