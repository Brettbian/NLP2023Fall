The sentiment of the sentence is generally negative because it is discussing a proposed dividend payment of 0.2 euro per share, which implies a loss or reduction in value for the company's shareholders

The use of the word ""propose"" and ""dividend"" suggests a negative financial situation for the company, as dividends are typically paid out of a company's profits

However, the use of ""Chief Business Excellence Officer"" itself is not inherently positive or negative It is a neutral title that can be seen as either positive (indicating success) or negative (indicating bureaucracy or rigidity) depending on the context in which it is used

The confidence level is 90% because while the title itself is neutral, the use of ""Eng"" in a professional context strongly suggests a positive sentiment The remaining 10% uncertainty comes from the possibility that the context in which the title is used could be negative
