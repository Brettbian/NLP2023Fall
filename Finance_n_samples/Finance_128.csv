Answer and Confidence: A: 95%, B: 3%, C: 2% 

Explanation: The sentiment of the sentence is largely positive The phrase ""is a Finnish company that owns, leases and builds office properties"" and ""and it specialises in facilities for technology-oriented businesses"" implies that the company has a specific skill or expertise in building office properties for technology-oriented businesses The word ""specialises"" carries a positive connotation as it suggests that the company has a unique ability or focus that sets it apart from others The remaining phrases continue to carry a positive tone with no negative language to counterbalance them The confidence level is relatively high because the language used in the sentence strongly suggests a positive sentiment, but there is a very small chance that the context or individual interpretation may skew the sentiment slightly differently

] ASSISTANT: 

Answer and Confidence: A$35 million, 85% Confidence Level: The sentence is stating a financial update about the value of a remaining stake in a company called Protalix, with an estimation of its worth at $27 million The positive sentiment is represented by the positive aspect of the financial stake being valued at a specific amount The choice of the word 'estimates' also contributes to the positive sentiment as it indicates a calculated and confident assessment of the stake's worth 

Alternative Interpretation: C$5 million, 15% Confidence Level: It is also possible to interpret the sentence as conveying a negative sentiment if the stake is being valued at a lower amount than expected This would be reflected in the choice of the word 'estimates' as it implies an estimation or guess, which could be seen as a lack of certainty or precision in the valuation However, this alternative interpretation is less likely given the overall tone and context of the sentence, particularly the use of the word 'valued at' rather than 'costs' or 'is' 

Sentence: [Marathon estimates the value of its remaining stake in Protalix at $ 27 million ] 

Please note that this analysis may not be 100% accurate, as language can be subjective and context can influence interpretation Additionally, without further context about Marathon or Protalix, it's possible that the sentiment could vary slightly

Explanation: The sentence provides information about the financial performance of a shipping company, specifically mentioning a pretax loss of EUR 65 mn in the third quarter of 2009 compared to a profit of EUR 03 mn in the same quarter of the previous year The use of numerical data and the contrast between positive and negative performance (a profit versus a loss) allows for a clear analysis of the sentiment The majority of the data points towards a positive sentiment, hence the high confidence level However, the slightest chance of the neutral sentiment being applied keeps the overall confidence level slightly below 100%

Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of this sentence is neutral as it is describing a factual event or occurrence rather than expressing any positive or negative emotions

Answer and Confidence: B: negative 

Explanation: Although the sentiment is still considered neutral, the use of the word 'will pay' and the addition of both cash and stock suggests a more active and involved stance in the deal 

However, this is not enough to sway the overall sentiment towards positive or negative, so the confidence level is quite low at 95%

The Moscow Metro was the first metro system in Europe to implement smart cards together with a new type of magnetic card in 1998 The sentence describes a factual event where the Moscow Metro became the first metro system in Europe to use smart cards and a new type of magnetic card in 1998 There is no emotional tone or bias in the sentence, making it neutral Hence, the correct sentiment is A: 100%

Confidence level: 85% - While the use of smart cards in a metro system is a significant achievement, it doesn't inherently carry a positive or negative sentiment Without further context, it is difficult to be 100% certain that this is indeed a correct sentiment However, given the straightforward nature of the sentence, the use of objective facts, and no apparent emotional language, the confidence level is still relatively high

] ASSISTANT: Answer and Confidence: B, 85%

The sentence mentions an increase in sales of security and system packaging, which could be interpreted as a positive development, especially if it is stated in the context of financial gain or progress towards a goal

However, the use of the word ""increased slightly"" can be seen as a modifier that could shift the sentiment towards neutral or even slightly negative if it is implied that the increase is not significant enough for a major positive impact

Overall, while the overall sentiment of the sentence leans towards positive, the use of the ""slightly"" modifier brings a degree of uncertainty that leads to a higher confidence level for the B option rather than the clear A option 

Sentence: [Sales of security and system packaging increased slightly] 

Confidence Level: 85% (This is a slightly more confident sentiment than the confidence level of the sentence itself, as the use of the ""slightly"" modifier could potentially change the overall sentiment from positive to neutral or even negative)

] ASSISTANT: 

Answer and Confidence: A: positive, 85% 

Explanation: The sentence describes a positive expectation or forecast for revenue for a quarter by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial The use of the specific figure of $69 million is also a positive indication of financial health and success The word ""expected"" adds to this positive sentiment as it indicates that the outcome is anticipated to be positive 

Sentence: [The company reported revenue of $ 69 million for the quarter ] 

Answer and Confidence: A: positive, 85% 

Explanation: The sentence has essentially the same sentiment as the previous sentence, as it also reports a positive outcome - the successful reporting of revenue at the quarter level The specificity of the figure also contributes to this positive sentiment 

Sentence: [The company's revenue for the quarter was reported at $ 69 million ] 

Answer and Confidence: A: positive, 85% 

Explanation: This sentence is identical in sentiment to the previous two, as it also reports a successful financial outcome - the achievement of revenue at the quarter level at a specific and large figure of $69 million The use of the verb ""was reported"" adds no negative sentiment and reinforces the positive sentiment conveyed by the rest of the sentence 

Sentence: [The analysts expected revenue of $ 69 million for the quarter ] 

Answer and Confidence: A: positive, 80% 

Explanation: This sentence is somewhat more ambiguous than the others in terms of sentiment, as it does not explicitly state that the revenue expectation is a positive outcome It instead describes a state of affairs that the analysts are expected to have an opinion on However, the use of the specific figure of $69 million is often seen as a positive indicator in financial contexts, so this may still lean slightly towards a positive sentiment overall

The sentence mentions that the Finnish department store chain Stockmann Oyj Abp net profit increased in the first nine months of 2007 as compared to the same period of 2006 

The use of numerical values to denote the rise in net profit indicates a positive financial performance for the company

Explanation: The sentence indicates a significant decline in sales for Nokia's handsets in the fourth quarter of 2009, by 35% from the previous quarter The negative sentiment is clearly expressed through this statement as it indicates a failure to meet sales targets or a decline in popularity The high confidence level is due to the straightforward and clear negative Connotation of the data presented in the sentence There may be some nuanced debates about whether this decline is truly negative or merely a reflection of a competitive market, but for the purpose of this assessment, the sentiment is clearly negative

] ASSISTANT: The sentence describes a financial situation with shares closing unchanged after being affected by negative news from Cargotec and Huhtamaki, who both reported disappointing second-quarter results 

Sentiment Analysis: The overall sentiment of the sentence is negative, with ""dropping sharply"" being a sign of a negative financial performance

Sentiment: B (negative)

Confidence Level: 90% 

I am quite confident in my analysis because ""dropping sharply"" is a clear indication of a negative change in the financial performance of the mentioned companies 

However, there is a small chance that the ""little changed"" phrase could be interpreted as a neutral observation, making the overall sentiment slightly closer to C (neutral) with a 10% confidence level 

But, considering the rest of the sentence, the negative sentiment is still the most appropriate 

Thus, my final answer and confidence level are: B (negative) at 90% confidence level 

Sentence: [HELSINKI Thomson Financial - Shares closed little changed , with Cargotec and Huhtamaki dropping sharply on disappointing second-quarter reports .
] 

Apologies for the earlier incorrect answer My confidence level was too high without considering the ""little changed"" phrase as a possible ambiguous element 

After reevaluating the sentence with this in mind, the correct sentiment is still negative with a high confidence level, but not at 100% 

Glad to have learned from my mistake and to have provided a more nuanced analysis

] ASSISTANT: Answer and Confidence: A: 90%, 

The Lithuanian beer market experiencing growth is generally viewed as a positive development The use of ""a rise of 08%"" further indicates a positive sentiment as it indicates progress over the previous year 

However, the phrase ""made up 1441 million liters"" could be seen as neutral or positive depending on the context of the broader conversation or compared to other industries 

Overall, the sentiment of the sentence leans towards positive, but with a slightly higher confidence level than the confidence level itself due to the potential nuance in the interpretation of the data

The sentence mentions that Outotec has received new orders worth 4929 million euros in the recent quarter, compared to 2404 million euros a year earlier This implies a positive sentiment as the company has reported an increase in the value of new orders received 

However, the confidence level is not 100% as the sentiment analysis can be slightly subjective and there could be arguments for a neutral sentiment if the increase in value of new orders was expected or anticipated by the viewer

Answer and Confidence: A, 95% 

The sentence is stating a fact that a group has reiterated a forecast about the number of handset units that will be sold this year globally It is positive in nature because it indicates confidence in the prediction and suggests a positive outcome for the industry The choice of the word ""reiterated"" also suggests a firm stance and repetition of an earlier statement, which is generally seen as positive in most contexts

However, the confidence level is not 100% because while the sentiment analysis of this type of information is usually very straightforward, there could be some nuances or additional context in this specific case that could potentially shift the sentiment to neutral or even negative But based solely on the information provided in this sentence, it is clearly positive

Confidence Level: 90%

Explanation: The sentence describes a decrease in operating profit from EUR 356 mn in the first quarter of 2008 to EUR 122 mn The use of the word 'down from' indicates a negative sentiment as it suggests a decline or negative change in the profit level This is further reinforced by the comparison to a previous higher figure The syntax within the sentence also leans towards a negative sentiment as it highlights the difference between the two periods

The sentence does not express any explicit positive or negative emotions, but it does contain information about the company's size and scope The ""approximately 47,000 persons"" and ""worldwide"" aspects could be seen as positive, as they imply a healthy and extensive workforce and presence However, these words could also be seen as neutral or even negative, as they do not convey any particular advantages over competitors or other companies In the end, the sentiment of the sentence leans slightly towards a positive perspective, but with a relatively high degree of uncertainty, hence the 75% confidence level

Explanation:

The sentence describes a positive event where Outotec Oyj has won two large minerals processing technology orders from Mirabela Mineracao do Brasil Ltda in Brazil and Cumerio Med JSCo in Bulgaria The use of the phrase ""large minerals processing technology orders"" is an indication that this is a significant achievement for Outotec Oyj, implying a positive sentiment In contrast, the use of the word ""Brazil"" and ""Bulgaria"" does not carry a positive or negative sentiment by itself, making it clear that the real driving factor for the sentiment is the winning of the orders There are no significant negative words or phrases in the sentence to suggest a negative sentiment The confidence level is relatively high because the sentiment is clearly positive, but there is always a small chance that the context or some less important words could change the overall sentiment

The given sentence provides information about financial performance and the delivery of products It is inherently neutral as it presents factual data without expressing any emotions or views 

The only possible sentiment that could be inferred from this sentence is positive The rise in net sales and the increase in the number of delivered chargers suggest that the entity in question is doing better in the year-on-year comparison This can be seen as a positive development However, the confidence level for this sentiment is not 100% because the wording of the sentence could also be seen as neutral or even positive without causing much doubt 

Overall, the confidence level is relatively high because the information presented in the sentence strongly suggests a positive sentiment, but there is also some room for interpretation that could lead to a different sentiment

Confidence Level Explanation:

The confidence level is a measure of how certain one is about their conclusion The higher the confidence level, the more certain one is that their interpretation is correct 

In this case, the confidence level is high because the sentence strongly suggests a positive sentiment based on the year-on-year increase in net sales and the number of delivered chargers 

However, there is always some degree of uncertainty in sentiment analysis, particularly with complex or ambiguous sentences Therefore, the confidence level is not 100%

The sentiment of the sentence is negative because it reports on a financial decline in the performance of a company (net profit falling to EUR 18 million from EUR 18 million), which suggests a negative financial outcome The confidence level is relatively high because the financial nature of the news clearly influences the sentiment expressed by the sentence however, there is a small possibility that the sentiment could be interpreted as neutral if the comparison was framed differently without the year over year decrease being explicitly stated</s>"

] ASSISTANT: 

Answer and Confidence: A: positive, 95%

The sentence ""Net sales of the Vegetable Oil Business rose to EUR 106 mn from EUR 101 mn"" indicates an positive increase in the sales of the Vegetable Oil Business This suggests a positive sentiment The confidence level is high because the sentence clearly indicates a positive change in the sales of the vegetable oil business 

Sentence: [The company achieved a significant increase in net sales in the last financial year  ]

Answer and Confidence: A: positive, 85%

The sentence ""The company achieved a significant increase in net sales in the last financial year"" indicates a positive achievement in the form of a significant increase in net sales This suggests a positive sentiment The confidence level is somewhat lower because while the increase in net sales is clearly positive, the phrase ""significant increase"" lacks specificity and could be used to convey a wider range of positive sentiments, including just a average increase 

Sentence: [The company did well in the last financial year  ]

Answer and Confidence: A: positive, 70%

The sentence ""The company did well in the last financial year"" indicates a positive sentiment The confidence level is lower because while the increase in net sales is clearly positive, the sentence on its own could also be interpreted as simply the presence of a financial report, making it more susceptible to interpretation and therefore less certain

The sentence ""The company's net sales went up in the last financial year"" indicates a positive sentiment The confidence level is higher than in the previous examples because the sentence clearly states a positive change in the company's net sales This is a clear indication of a positive outcome and is less susceptible to interpretation 

Sentence: [The company performed well financially in the last year  ]

Answer and Confidence: A: positive, 65%

The sentence ""The company performed well financially in the last year"" indicates a positive sentiment The confidence level is lower than some of the other examples because the phrase ""performed well"" could be interpreted as merely meeting expectations rather than achieving a significant increase, which"

] ASSISTANT: 

Answer and Confidence: B: negative, 85% 

The sentence mentions a significant increase in profit from 2004 to a later period The use of ""up from"" indicates a positive change in the situation, however, the following amount descriptor ""EUR 98 mn"" could potentially shift the sentiment back to positive if the difference in the amount was highlighted instead of the fact that it was up from 2004 Therefore, with a slight hesitation, the sentiment is still considered negative

Answer and Confidence: A: positive, 15% 

Sentence: [Profit for the period was EUR 98 mn , up from EUR 60 mn in 2004 .

Explanation: The sentence states a positive change in profit for a period compared to previous years The use of ""up from"" in a financial context is often used to signify growth or improvement Therefore, although the confidence level is relatively low due to the subtlety of the sentiment in this context, the sentiment itself is still represented as positive 

Confidence Interval: 5-95% 

Note: This confidence level is provided as an additional piece of information and should be taken with a grain of salt due to the small sample size and the potential influence on the confidence level of the specific context of the sentence

The sentence reports a fact about profit for a period compared to previous years The use of ""up from"" is neutral in and of itself, as it could be used to describe any kind of increase, whether it is positive or negative The amount descriptors ""EUR 98 mn"" and ""EUR 60 mn"" do not carry any emotional weight on their own, so the overall sentiment is difficult to discern without additional context The confidence level is relatively high due to the lack of sentiment indicators in the sentence, but it is still possible that the overall sentiment could"

] ASSISTANT: Answer and Confidence: A 85%, The cost of the deal is being discussed and its range is mentioned based on the performance of the companies in 2008 The sentiment here is positive as the conversation is about the cost of the deal and the confidence level is relatively high because the sentence provides specific information and does not express an outright negative emotion

Sentence: The cost of the deal could range from 70 million to 90 million euros depending on the financial results of the two companies in 2008 , the statement says 

Explanation:

The sentence is discussing the cost of a deal and provides information on its possible range based on the performance of two companies in 2008 The use of the phrases ""could range"" and ""depending on"" suggests that the cost of the deal may vary and is subject to certain conditions The presence of these phrases does not necessarily indicate a negative sentiment as they could be used in a neutral or positive context to provide information rather than express an emotional stance

However, the sentiment analysis is not without its limitations since the context of the statement and the intended meaning behind the words may influence the overall sentiment Therefore, while the sentiment appears to be positive based solely on the information provided, a small percentage of confidence is retained to account for possible unseen context or alternative interpretations

Overall, the high confidence level is warranted due to the specific cost information provided in the sentence, but a degree of caution is necessary in any sentiment analysis due to the potential for unseen context or emotions that may not be directly stated in the sentence itself</s>"

The sentence ""Cision says the sale will return its U.K. operation to profitability"" can be interpreted as a positive development for Cision's U.K. operation as the sale is expected to bring it back to profitability The use of the word ""return"" has a positive connotation as it indicates progress or improvement The confidence level is relatively high because the sentence contains no clear indicators of a negative sentiment, but there is always a small possibility that the meaning of a sentence can be subjective and interpretation may vary

The sentiment analysis of this sentence is quite straightforward as the negative Conceptual Opinion Words (COW) such as ""contract"", ""lower"", and ""decrease"" clearly outnumber the positive ones The remaining COW, such as ""healthy level"" and ""new order prospects"", do not change the overall negative sentiment of the sentence because they are not directly contrasted with positive ideas or expectations The confidence level is relatively high because the sentiment seems to be the main idea of the sentence, and there are no ambiguous words or phrases that could change this sentiment

] ASSISTANT: The value of the orders is over EUR 25mn 

Answer and Confidence: A: positive, 90% 

Explanation: The sentence mentions the value of the orders being over EUR 25mn The use of the comma separates the value of the orders from the rest of the sentence, indicating that the value is a important or noteworthy aspect of the order Placing this piece of information at the beginning of the sentence suggests that the speaker or writer wants to emphasize or highlight this aspect of the order, which is typically associated with a positive sentiment

Sentiment: Positive

Sentence: [The value of the orders is over EUR 25mn  ]

Confidence Level: 90%

Note: While the interpretation of the sentiment in this case may appear straightforward, I offer a confidence level of 90% because the use of the comma could potentially be used in a different context where the value of the order is not necessarily meant to be highlighted as positive Therefore, while the most likely interpretation is a positive sentiment, there is a small chance that the overall meaning of the sentence could be neutral or even negative in a different context

] ASSISTANT: 

Answer and Confidence: B 70%

The sentence describes a positive change in the net sales of a division, but the wording is somewhat formal and does not convey an overwhelmingly positive sentiment The use of ""adjusted for changes in the Group structure"" could suggest some challenges or issues that were addressed, which could balance out the positive news of the net sales increase Confidence level is relatively high because the language used does suggest a positive outcome, but there are also other factors that could offset this sentiment that would make it difficult to call with 100% certainty

Answer and Confidence: A, 95% 

Explanation: The sentence ""It will report full-year results on August 22"" is providing an update or status on when the entity will present its financial results The use of the verb ""will report"" and the specificity of the date ""August 22"" leans towards a positive sentiment as it indicates progress or a positive development In order to reach a 100% confidence level, there could be scenarios where the context of the sentence alters the sentiment (for example, if the report is expected to be negative or neutral but the date is mentioned in a casual manner without any impact being stated) However, based on the information provided in the sentence alone, the sentiment is likely to be positive

] ASSISTANT: 

Answer and Confidence: A: 85%, B: 15%, C: 0% 

Explanation: The sentence describes a financial change in the behavior of a company, specifically mentioning a decrease in net profit The use of specific numerical figures (EUR 1.4 million and EUR 1.5 million) allows for a clear comparison and comparison of years The nature of this decrease indicates some sort of negative financial performance, which would generally be considered negative news This leads me to conclude that the sentiment of the sentence is negative with a high degree of confidence However, as the confidence level is not 100%, there is still a small possibility that the sentiment could be neutral or positive in a different context (for example, if the decrease was expected or part of a longer-term positive trend) 

Sentence: [However , the company saw its net profit for the third quarter down to EUR 1.4 million from EUR 1.5 million for the corresponding period of 2009 .] 

Sentiment: Negative 

Confidence Level: 85% 

Note: This analysis assumes a straightforward interpretation of the financial decrease as a negative event Without additional context, this interpretation is the most logical 

Butterfly Effect: 

10%: The decrease could be part of a larger positive trend 
5%: The decrease could be expected or planned 

The confidence level for these alternative perspectives is relatively low because they are not directly supported by the information given in the sentence The Butterfly Effect represents the small changes that can have a significant impact on a system, but in this case, the alternative perspectives do not significantly change the overall negative sentiment of the main branch 

Overall, the confidence level is high because the financial decrease in the context of a comparison with a previous year is a clear sign of negative performance The rest of the sentence reinforces this interpretation, making it unlikely that the sentiment could be anything other than negative 

Sentence: [However , the company saw its net profit for the third quarter down to EUR 1 4 million from EUR 1 5 million for the corresponding period of 2009 .]

The sentence describes a decrease in the operating profit of the Bank of 脜land in Finland between the second quarter of 2007 and the same quarter in 2008 The use of specific numbers (EUR 75 mn and EUR 61 mn) provides a concrete basis for the sentiment analysis The trend suggested by the decrease in profit is generally considered negative in the context of finance and business Therefore, the correct sentiment for this sentence is negative The confidence level is relatively high because the information in the sentence clearly suggests a negative sentiment, but there is always a small possibility that the context or additional information could alter the sentiment 

Sentence: [In Finland , the Bank of +脿land reports its operating profit fell to EUR 61 mn in the second quarter of 2008 from EUR 75 mn in the second quarter of 2007  ]

] ASSISTANT: 

Answer and Confidence: A: 85%, 

Explanation: The sentence provides information about Qualcomm's estimated first-quarter profit, which is expressed as a range of 46 to 50 cents a share, excluding certain items The fact that this profit estimate is below the analyst's estimate of 61 cents a share suggests a negative sentiment as it implies that Qualcomm's profit is lower than what was expected This is supported by the use of the word ""estimated"", indicating that this is not a definite guarantee of profit, further lending a negative sentiment The confidence level is high because the numerical data in the sentence clearly conveys a comparison and a lower value, which strongly suggests a negative sentiment, but I am also aware that sentiment analysis can be subjective and there could be other interpretations, hence the not quite 100% confidence level 

Sentence: [Qualcomm estimated a first-quarter profit between 46 and 50 cents a share , excluding certain items , below the analyst estimate of 61 cents a share .]

The sentence mentions that ""The Department Store Division's sales fell by 86% to EUR 1402 mn"" The use of positive words like ""fell"" and ""increased"" with a high percentage change indicates a positive sentiment The confidence level is relatively high because the sentence contains clear numerical data that supports the positive sentiment However, without additional context, there could be a hypothetical situation where the fall in sales is still seen as negative due to an overall goal or expectation of growth, which would adjust the sentiment to negative at a 75% confidence level

Explanation: The sentence is describing the features and availability of a product called ""QPR ProcessGuide"" which can be used as a system solution or a standalone desktop version There are no explicit positive or negative words or phrases that would indicate a particular sentiment Therefore, the most logical sentiment to adopt is neutral, as the sentence is purely informative and lacks any emotional language or bias 

However, upon further analysis, there is a slight leaning towards the positive sentiment because the description of ""centralized storage and management of process content"" and ""standalone desktop version"" could be seen as positive aspects for a product, especially in the context of process content management 

But, considering the lack of emotional language, the neutral sentiment is still the most appropriate

The sentence ""The parties have therefore agreed to leave Avena out of the deal"" indicates a positive sentiment because it suggests a positive agreement between parties The use of the word ""agreed"" adds to this positive Contrastingly, the phrase ""out of the deal"" does not have any negative connotations by itself, further reinforcing the positive sentiment

Answer and Confidence: B: negative, 85% 

The sentence describes a decrease in profit from one year to another (from EUR 11 mn to EUR 08 mn), which indicates a negative sentiment The word 'down' also contributes to this sentiment as it suggests a decline or negative change 

However, the confidence level is not 100% because the context of the decrease in profit could potentially be explained by larger business strategies or events, which might not necessarily be negative overall But based solemostly on the information provided in the sentence, the sentiment is negative

Answer and Confidence: B: negative, 70% 









 

 
 
 The confidence level is lower because while the word 'down' in the context of finance is often negative, it could also be interpreted as a comparison between different periods, which might not necessarily be negative overall But based on the sole presence of the word 'down', the sentiment can be classified as negative

] ASSISTANT: 

Answer and Confidence: A: Positive 

Confidence Level: 95%

Explanation:

The sentence mentions that both operating profit and net sales for a six-month period have increased, respectively, from EUR181m and EUR1276m, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006

Centrally, the sentence communicates positive financial improvements and profitable growth, which is reflected in the choice of direct and indirect positive comparative words such as 'increased', 'respectively', 'as compared to', and 'from'

The term 'increased' is particularly important in this context as it indicates positive growth and can be used both in business and personal contexts to indicate progress or success

Given the positive nature of the information being conveyed, the sentiment of the sentence is clearly positive



Sentence: [The new restaurant is open for business today]
]

Answer and Confidence: B: Negative 

Confidence Level: 85%

Explanation:

The sentence states that 'The new restaurant is open for business today'

While the use of the verb 'open' is neutral by itself, the context of the sentence suggests a negative sentiment

The sentence is announcing business operations, which implies that the restaurant may have been previously closed or in a state of preparation, suggesting that it is now functioning normally or meeting a deadline, all of which can be seen as positive developments, but in the context of a larger conversation or comparison, it can be seen as negative because it indicates progress or completion, rather than a state of inactivity or non-performance

Given this nuanced interpretation, I choose to interpret the sentiment of the sentence as negative with a high degree of confidence, although it could be seen as positive depending on the context



Sentence: [She is very happy about her promotion]

Answer and Confidence: A: Positive

The use of the phrase 'very happy' conveys a positive sentiment as it indicates strong happiness or satisfaction

The sentence also uses the word 'about her promotion', which further emphasizes the"

] ASSISTANT: 

Answer and Confidence: A, 95% 

Explanation: The sentence is primarily discussing a financial aspect of a company, with the announcement of a dividend for the year 2008 at the annual general meeting The use of specific numerical data (EUR 014) further reinforces the objective, factual tone of the sentence The suggestion by the board of directors to propose this dividend is likely to be seen as a positive or neutral development, as it is a standard aspect of corporate financial management, rather than having a clearly positive or negative connotation 

Sentence: [The company 's board of directors will propose a dividend of EUR 014 for 2008 at the annual general meeting .] 

Confidence: 95% (Almost certain) 

Note: While the sentiment analysis is generally reliable, there is always a small chance that the interpretation of the data may not be entirely accurate In this case, the confidence level is quite high due to the straightforward, objective nature of the sentence

] ASSISTANT: Answer and Confidence: A: 85%, B: 15%, C: 3%

Explanation:
The sentence describes a significant decrease in the profit before taxes of a company between 2007 and 2008 The use of specific numerical adjectives (""EUR 21.1 mn"" and ""EUR 35.8 mn"") provides a concrete basis for the evaluation of the financial health of the company The comparison between the two periods reinforces the idea that the profit has decreased, which indicates an unfavorable or negative situation Therefore, the sentiment of the sentence is negative

Answer and Confidence: B 

The sentence describes a financial arrangement in which a large amount of money (EUR 220 million) was paid in the form of interest-bearing vendor notes over a period of four years The use of the word ""consideration"" in the context of a financial transaction suggests that this is a positive sentiment towards the transaction The presence of the detail ""interest-bearing"" further implies a positive sentiment as it indicates a mutually agreed upon financial arrangement with interest The only potential negative sentiment could be if the interest rate was excessively high, but this is not stated in the sentence Therefore, the confidence level is relatively high at 85%

] ASSISTANT: The transaction included the transfer of the lease agreement concerning manufacturing premises and employment agreements related to these operations 

Answer and Confidence: B, 85% 

The sentence mentions a transaction that involves the transfer of a lease agreement and employment agreements This suggests a negative sentiment as it likely indicates some sort of cost or inconvenience to the parties involved The words ""lease agreement"" and ""employment agreements"" also carry a negative sentiment as they are often associated with financial and legal responsibilities

However, the specific use of the passive voice (""included also"") could be interpreted as neutral depending on the context of the larger conversation or situation Hence the confidence level is not 100%, as it could very well be a positive sentiment depending on the context

] ASSISTANT: The value of the total investment is about EUR 600mn 

Answer and Confidence: A: positive, 95%

The sentence describes a financial metric - the value of an investment - with a specific amount (EUR 600mn)

Sentiments in the financial context are usually positive when the value is large or positive (e g, exceeding expectations, reaching a milestone), and negative when it is small or negative (e g, falling short, not meeting targets)

Since the sentiment is generally positive in the context of finance, the confidence level is relatively high

However, without additional context or comparison to other financial metrics, there is a small possibility that the sentiment could be neutral

Therefore, the choice of words (large value, investment) suggests a positive sentiment but could be slightly misleading without further context 

Sentence: The value of the total investment is about EUR 600mn 

Sentiment: positive 

Confidence: 95% 

Additional Sentence: There is a 5% chance that the sentiment could be neutral due to the need for additional context

Explanation: The sentence describes a decrease in operating profit, excluding non-recurring items, from EUR 2.7 mn in 2008 to EUR 2.2 mn The use of the word 'down from' indicates a negative sentiment as it suggests a decline or negative change in the expected or previous state 

Sentence: [The company 's actual result 2009-2010 was lower than the company 's forecast at the beginning of the year 2009 ]

Answer and Confidence: B: negative, 90% 

Explanation: The sentence compares the actual result of a company's activity from 2009 to 2010 to its forecast at the beginning of the year The use of the word 'lower than' indicates a negative sentiment as it suggests a failure to meet expectations or achieve a desired state or goal 

Sentence: [Sales of the Company 's products totalled EUR 40 mn in the period 2009-2010 ]

Answer and Confidence: A: positive, 70% 

Explanation: The sentence simply states a fact about the sales of the company's products, without any negative or positive connotations The word 'totalled' is neutral, but the word 'EUR 40 mn' could be seen as a positive sentiment as it indicates a successful revenue generation, but without additional context, it is difficult to be certain 

Sentence: [In the first six months of 2009, the company 's result was higher than the company 's result in the corresponding period in 2008 ]

Answer and Confidence: B: negative, 80% 

Explanation: The sentence compares the result of the company in the first six months of 2009 to its result in the corresponding period in 2008 The use of the word 'higher than' could be seen as a negative sentiment as it suggests a decline or negative change in the current state compared to a previous period

] ASSISTANT: 

Answer and Confidence: A: 95%, 

The sentiment of the sentence is primarily positive because it mentions a ""similar position outside the Sanoma Group,"" which suggests that the subject (Erkki Jarvinen, President of Rautakirja) will be leaving his current tasks to take on a new role with prospects of success outside of the group 

The word ""spring 2009"" is also a positive aspect as it indicates a transition or development, rather than a negative termination or dismissal

However, the confidence level is not 100% because the sentence could be interpreted in a neutral or even positive way without the specific details mentioned (such as 'spring 2009' or 'outside the Sanoma Group') The reason why I'm not 100% confident is that without these details, the sentiment could be more neutral or positive, but with them, the sentiment leans more towards positive

] ASSISTANT: Answer and Confidence: B, 85%

The sentence mentions ""medium-term operative targets of the company remain unchanged"" which suggests that there are no plans to change the goals or performance levels of the company in the medium term This can be interpreted as a negative sentiment as it indicates stability or a lack of progress or change, which can be seen as negative for a company 

However, the word ""unchanged"" can also be seen as neutral, as it simply states a fact without having a particularly positive or negative connotation on its own Therefore, while I believe the overall sentiment is negative, there is a slight chance that the sentiment could be neutral depending on the context in which this sentence is used 

Sentence: The medium-term operative targets of the company remain unchanged 

Confidence Level: 85% (Because the negative sentiment still predominates, but there is also a possibility that it could be neutral)

Answer and Confidence: B: negative, 85% 

Explanation: The sentence describes a decrease in profit from EUR 143 mn in 2009 to EUR 109 mn in a later period The use of negative language, such as the decrease in profit, suggests a negative sentiment The confidence level is relatively high because the language used in the sentence clearly suggests a negative sentiment, but there is always a small possibility that the context could alter the sentiment

Answer and Confidence: A: positive, 90% 

Explanation: The sentence expresses a financial goal or aim of achieving a return on investment of 15% The use of positive language, such as the expression of a desirable outcome or goal, suggests a positive sentiment The high confidence level is due to the clear positive sentiment conveyed by the sentence, but I am still open to the possibility that the context could shift the sentiment slightly

The sentence ""The fine print is here"" is a statement indicating the presence of detailed information or terms and conditions, which is generally a positive sentiment as it is informative and does not convey any negative emotions or opinions

Explanation: The sentence describes a positive financial improvement in cash flow for a particular entity, with a marked positive change in the amount of cash flow generated compared to previous years 

Sentence: [Cash flow from operations totalled EUR 74 mn, compared to a negative EUR 686 mn in the second quarter of 2008]
